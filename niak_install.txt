#summary How to install the NIAK

==General instruction==

To install the NIAK, download the file niak-0.2.tar.gz, uncompress it in a folder `path_niak`, and add this path (with all subfolders) to your matlab or octave path :
{{{
path_niak = '/home/pbellec/bibliotheque/niak/';
P = genpath(path_niak);
addpath(P);
}}}

You may have to edit the file `path_niak`/'commands/misc/niak_gb_vars/' to change a couple of variables, notably the path to access the demo data. You need to download the [DocumentationDemo demo] data independently from [http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/users/pbellec/demo_niak/ here] and copy the data in any format in the folder `PATH_NIAK/data_demo/`.

==Compatibility and dependencies==

Release 0.2 has been tested on Linux and should work fine on Windows or Mac OSX.

The NIAK has been tested with Matlab 6.5 and Matlab 7.0.1 (R14). NIAK r0.2 should also work with Octave 2.9+, but it is not compatible with Octave 2.1~.

For most operation you will need at least a version of the MINC tools available. MINC tools are available for LINUX and MAC OSX [http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ here]. There should be a windows version soon.
